# NumberOf1Bits
LeetCode 191. Number of 1 Bits in Java
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/

At first the description of the problem and the test cases do
not seem to agree. I guess it does.

We need to return the number of bits set to 1 in an unsigned
integer.

If interested in this problem please read the description in
the LeetCode web site. If interested in my comments I invite
you to read the following post in my blog:

Keep in mind that one of the best ways to lear is to read 
and experiment. I would like to it the word repeat.
Practice makes perfect.

Enjoy;
